# hello-world-
website project 

I am trying to create a connec-the-dots function for my website. 
Each dot will contain images/files of my works and will expand upon clicking the dot. 
However, I am trying to find a way to track the viewer's clicked path form dot to dot by indicating lines- similar to connec the dots. 
How might I go about creating a function like this? 

Thank you
